## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## create a function called ‘makeVector’ with an empty numeric vector as default value
## set 'solv' as an empty vector
## create a function called ‘set’ 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
